Hyderabad is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana and the de jure capital of Andhra Pradesh.[A] <p>It occupies 650 square kilometres (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of South India. With an average altitude of 542 metres (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes<p> including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 Census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India.

<i>@Picture Of the Charminar</i>
</p>
<p>The Charminar (lit "four minarets") constructed in 1591, is a monument and mosque located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.<p> The landmark has become known globally as a symbol of Hyderabad and is listed among the most recognised structures in India. <p>It has also been officially incorporated as the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 400 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr.[4]
